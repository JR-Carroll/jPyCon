jPyCon is a Win7 (x32/x64) based folder-icon assignment tool.  Currently, to assign an icon to a win7 folder you have to jump through a lot of hoops to make things work - and quite frankly, that sucks!  This script asks which folder you want to update, the icon folder, and which icon image you want to update.  Then it updates the document for you adding the necessary *.ini files (system/hidden) to the folder itself thus making it prime for icon decorations!  

Note:  To get this to work, you may have to refresh (F5) or even reboot (in some rare cases).
